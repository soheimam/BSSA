            <blockquote>
                The profession of interior design is just over 100 years old. In these hundred years, what began as the art of decorating,
                embracing form and function, has evolved by leaps and bounds into today’s world of highly specialized areas
                of interior design that require years of study and experience. In the early 1900’s, the term “Interior Decorator”
                was first used in America. Most decorators at the time had no academic credentials, but the best of them
                had a combination of good taste, common senses, and natural talent to interpret and address the issues, such
                as scale and proportion. Elsie de Wolfe became the first Interior Decorator to be given a design “commission.”
                In 1913, Elsie de Wolfe published the first interior design book, “The House in Good Taste.” Dorothy Draper
                was the first documented commercial Interior Decorator, establishing her design firm in 1923.

                In 1954, the Brooklyn Museum held its "Design in Scandinavia" exhibition, and a fashion for "Scandinavian Modern" furniture
                began in America.Scandinavian design is by no means limited to furniture and household goods. It has been
                applied to industrial design, such as of consumer electronics,mobile phones,and cars.

                Danish Design
            </h2>
            <blockquote>
                Danish Design is a style of functionalistic design and architecture that was developed in mid-20th century. Influenced by
                the German Bauhaus school, many Danish designers used the new industrial technologies, combined with ideas
                of simplicity and functionalism to design buildings, furniture and household objects, many of which have
                become iconic and are still in use and production, such as Arne Jacobsen's 1958 Egg chair[11] and Poul Henningsen's
                1926 PH-lamps.[12] After the Second World War, conditions in Denmark were ideally suited to success in design.
                The emphasis was on furniture but architecture, silver, ceramics, glass and textiles also benefitted from
                the trend. Denmark's late industrialisation combined with a tradition of high-quality craftsmanship formed
                the basis of gradual progress towards industrial production

                Finnish design spans clothing, engineering design, furniture, glass, lighting, textiles, and household products.The "Design
                from Finland" mark was created in 2011.[15] Finland's Design Museum (formerly called the Museum of Art and
                Design) has a collection founded in 1873, while Helsinki's University of Art and Design, established in 1871,
                now forms part of Aalto University.

                Icelandic Design
            </h2>
            <blockquote>
                Design in Iceland is a relatively young tradition, starting in the 1950s but now growing rapidly. The country's limited options
                for manufacturing and its constrained choice of materials have both forced designers to be innovative, though
                wool remains a staple material, whether felted or knitted. Iceland's Museum of Design and Applied Art, aiming
                to record Icelandic design from 1900 onwards, opened in 1998.[18] The Iceland Academy of the Arts was also
                founded in 1998, soon followed by its Faculty of Architecture and Design, which has promoted a distinctively
                Icelandic character in the nation's design

            <blockquote>
                Swedish design is considered minimalist, with an emphasis on functionality and simple clean lines. This has applied especially
                to furniture. Sweden is known for traditional crafts including glass and Sami handicrafts. Swedish design
                was pioneered by Anders Beckman (graphics), Bruno Mathsson (furniture), Märta Måås-Fjetterström and Astrid
                Sampe (textile), and Sixten Sason (industrial). Organisations that promote design in Sweden are Svensk Form,
                the Swedish society of crafts and design, founded in 1845; the Swedish Industrial Design Foundation, known
                as SVID; the Swedish Arts Council; and the Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design (known as ArkDes) on
                the island of Skeppsholmen in Stockholm, beside the modern art museum
